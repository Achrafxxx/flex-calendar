# FlexCalendar

A Elegant Calendar Built With Angular.js

## Installation

Add to index.html:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/flex-calendar.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/flex-calendar.js"></script>
```

Inject ``'russian60.flex-calendar'`` into your main module:

```javascript
angular.module('App', ['flex-calendar'])
```

## Usage

Add ``<flex-calendar options="options" events="events"></flex-calendar>`` directive to your html file.

Flex Calendar takes a few options:

```javascript
app.controller('SchedulingController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
  // Dates can be passed as strings or Date objects 
  $scope.options = {
    defaultDate: "2015-06-23",
    minDate: new Date([2015, 06, 12]),
    maxDate: new Date([2015, 12, 31]),
    dayNamesLength: 1, // 1 for "M", 2 for "Mo", 3 for "Mon"; 9 will show full day names. Default is 1.
    eventClick: function(date) {
      console.log(date);
    },
    dateClick: function(date) {
      console.log(date);
    },
    changeMonth: function(month) {
      console.log(month);
    }
  };
  
  $scope.events = [
    {foo: 'bar', date: new Date([2015, 12, 31])},
    {foo: 'bar', date: new Date([2015, 6, 4])}
  ];
}]);
```
